			<p class="staffText">Nicole Urbanowski graduated from Boston University with a BS in Therapeutic Sciences and minor in Dance; and a Masters of Science in Occupational Therapy with a focus in Pediatrics. Nicole has recently relocated from the northeast where she fostered a passion for working with children in the school systems as well as afterschool and summer camp programs. Nicole believes that her excitement for pediatrics comes from the philosophy that children learn best while playing.</p>
			<p class="staffText">Most recently, Nicole worked as the Program Director for YMCA Camp Lincoln in Kingston, NH. Nicole’s experience includes pediatric outpatient service, school district caseload management including development and leadership of therapeutic groups for identified at-risk students within the school system. Nicole is also a passionate dancer from a young age, competing and performing nationally and while in Boston, performing with local contemporary and ballet companies. Nicole is excited to be in Florida and join the Fitness Quest team.</p>
