			<p class="staffText">I was born in Ontario, Canada. After relocating to Florida, I eventually attended the University of Florida and graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Science degree in Occupational Therapy. During my early years of practice in Occupational Therapy, I developed a special interest in Hand Rehabilitation. With a strong desire for advanced competency and a personal dedication to the profession of Hand Therapy, I ultimately obtained my certification in Hand Therapy in 1991, becoming the first Certified Hand Therapist in Charlotte County. Certification involves meeting rigorous standards and acquiring advanced training and study in order to pass the certification examination. The CHT credential provides assurance that the therapist has attained the highest level of competency in the profession and remains current with practice within the field.</p>
			<p class="staffText">Since obtaining my certification and successfully recertifying every 5 years, I continue to derive great personal satisfaction from helping people achieve the maximum restoration of their hand function following injury. I am a member of the American Society of Hand Therapists, American Occupational Therapy Association, Florida Hand Society and the Florida Occupational Therapy Association. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, art, traveling, swimming, biking, hiking, yoga and giving back to the community.</p>
