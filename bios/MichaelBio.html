			<p class="staffText">Michael Morrison DPT has been part of the Fitness Quest team since 2008. He received his Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology from The College of William and Mary in 2001, and earned his Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from the University of Colorado, where he was the president of his class, in 2008. While in grad school Michael had the opportunity to study in Australia where he refined his manual intervention skills which he uses in conjunction with individualized exercises to improve overall function and quality of life for his patients. Michael also has training in running analysis and injury prevention/treatment for runners.</p>
			<p class="staffText">Michael became interested in physical therapy because he is a self-described “people person” who loves to encourage others to perform at their best and enjoy healthy living. You will see from your first visit that he cares about giving you the individual attention and treatment that is appropriate for your situation and will get you back to the things that are important in your life.</p>
			<p class="staffText">Michael is an avid distance runner who enjoys ½ marathons, triathlons, and just about any sport, specifically, soccer. He also enjoys camping and hiking and has recently begun section hiking the Appalachian Trail with his brother. He also loves hanging out with his beautiful wife, who is an amazing cook, musician, and photographer.</p>
