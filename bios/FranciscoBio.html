			<p class="staffText">Our physical therapist and Director of Operations Francisco Ramirez grew up in Charlotte County. After graduating from Charlotte High School in 1981 he started a career with The Brown Derby restaurant in Fort Myers, Florida where he learned his customer service skills.  Realizing his love for the medical field cultured by his parents who are physicians in Charlotte and Lee counties, he finished the physical therapy program at Florida A&M University located in Tallahassee, Florida.  After eleven years of practice in a myriad of settings (acute, long term care, rehabilitation, sports clinic, spine clinic and outpatient) he brings vast knowledge of therapy catered to individual needs.</p>
			<p class="staffText">He continues to expand his knowledge to stay updated with the latest research through continuing education and assisting in the establishment of post rehab protocols for Articular Joint Program for The Knee and the MedX protocol and he is also in the process of getting his certification for Hand Therapy. When not helping patients address their functional limitations, he loves to spend his free time with his family, enjoying fine North Port life among its great people.  On any given weekend morning, you may spot him either riding his bicycle at break-neck speed or enjoying a run through the trails of North Port.  Francisco Ramirez, PT- the therapist for the community.</p>
