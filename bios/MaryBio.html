			<p class="staffText">Mary is from Manitowoc, WI.  She moved to Punta Gorda in May, 2011. I Graduated Magna Cum Laude from Marquette University's Doctor of Physical Therapy program in Milwaukee, WI in 2009.  Continuing education in orthopedics, joint replacements, stroke recovery, and special interests in pilates and yoga inspired exercise.  I entered the field of Physical Therapy because I am passionate about helping others to live and maintain an active lifestyle. I value the importance of taking the time to educate my patients on ways to prevent injury, restore functional mobility, and promote optimal health and wellness. My hobbies include running, cycling, volleyball, and, since moving to Florida, a beginning tennis player! Myself and the entire staff at Fitness Quest thoroughly understand the intricate system of how the human body moves and are professionally trained to create individual treatment plans to assist you in getting back on track.</p>
